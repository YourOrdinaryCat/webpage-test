# What is this?
Great question, random GitHub dude that I just made up! The answer is, in fact, nothing. I might upload randomly from time to time but this is just a test. Now you could:

- Go away
- Look at nothing
- Vomit because my CSS is crap and I never get anything done

idk man I spent more time making this readme than perfecting my css so yeah messy af
