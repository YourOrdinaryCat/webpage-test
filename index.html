    <p>Hey fellow bread lover. I think we can agree on the fact that bread deserves
      more recognition. It's truly a versatile food, and it stood the test of time
      really well. You may not like some variants, and that's okay! But bread is
      undeniably great. That's why I made Dough Project! With your help, we'll be
      able to establish a fully functional bread kingdom.</p>

    <p>Down below we'll take a look at the history of bread, the different variants,
      you know the deal.</p>

        <p>Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water,
          usually by baking. Throughout recorded history, it has been a prominent
          food in large parts of the world. It is one of the oldest man-made foods,
          having been of significant importance since the dawn of agriculture, and
          plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.</p>
          
        <p>Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes, chemicals,
          industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration. In many countries,
          commercial bread often contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color,
          shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.</p>

        <p>In other words, bread is the best food to ever exist. It's very important
          in our daily life and has served humanity for generations. Bread was and still
          is truly the beginning of a new tomorrow. And this is only one small step
          towards the ultimate bread form, where it trascends and asserts dominance. I
          love bread, it's truly the best food ever, period. If you argue there's
          anything better than my trustworthy bread (unless it's cats ofc), your last
          words will be exactly those you had the "courage" to spit out of your mouth.</p>

        <p>Sourdough bread is made with a starter which is essentially a mixture of flour
          and water that attracts wild yeast in the air and ferments it within itself so
          it can be used as a leavening agent. Most artisanal sourdough bread have very high
          hydration rates, around 65 to 70 percent, that is the amount of water is 65 to 70
          percent of the amount of flour by weight. To bake them, they will use a very hot
          oven that's also aided with steam to keep the outer layer of the dough moist so it
          rises well without cracking like a pasty white girl at 38.</p>
