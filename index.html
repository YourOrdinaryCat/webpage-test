        <p>Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water,
          usually by baking. Throughout recorded history, it has been a prominent
          food in large parts of the world. It is one of the oldest man-made foods,
          having been of significant importance since the dawn of agriculture, and
          plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.</p>
          
        <p>Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes, chemicals,
          industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration. In many countries,
          commercial bread often contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color,
          shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.</p>
